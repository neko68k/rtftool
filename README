= RTFTool - R-Type Final Asset Viewer/Exporter =
================================================

---Getting Started---
Copy these files from your R-Type Final disc to the same folder as RTFTool.exe.
-COMMON.DAT	\ Contains all the textures in the game.
-COMMON.FAT	/
-ROOT.DAT	\Contains all the models and textures they need.
-ROOT.FAT	/

---Viewing Game Models---
*Open COMMON.FAT(not COMMON.DAT, this is important!) in RTFTool. All of the main game models are in this file.
*Choose File|Export|All
	-This exports all the DAT files to a folder called /export
*You may now open any of the exported DAT files.
*View files by double clicking.
*Export from File menu or right click on the file list.

File types are as follows:
*P6T - Texture
	All P6T are supported and can be exported as 32-bit TGA, flipped or unflipped.
*IMD - Model
	Not all models are supported. Not all features on the supported models are 
	implemented. Sometimes models don't load the first time, try again. The rotation
	interface sucks, I'm sorry. Drag on the view to rotate. Right click to reset view.
*TM2 - PS2 Image 
	This tool doesn't support viewing or converting(but exporting works) these. XN View supports these.
*INT - Streaming Music
	Inside STR.FAT. They are PS2 ADPCM, I'm not sure how to listen properly.
*HD,BD,SQ - Unknown
	Probably sound effects. Inside SE.FAT I dont know anything else about these files.
*ICO,SYS - PS2 Memory Card Icon
	Unsupported in this program but there are others that read them if exported.
